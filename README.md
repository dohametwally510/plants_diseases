Objectives
**************************
- To detect unhealthy regions of plants leave

- Classification of plants leaf disease using texture feature

- To analyze leaf infection

Model Used
***********************
CNN Model 1
CNN Model 2
VGG16
Resnet50

Conclusion
************************
This project demonstrates the potential of computer vision techniques and deep learning models for plant disease classification. By leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning, we were able to build a robust model with high accuracy. Such models can be valuable tools for farmers and plant experts to quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases, leading to timely interventions and improved crop health.
